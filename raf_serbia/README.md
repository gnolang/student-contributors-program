**RAF Serbia** 

The **Student Contributor Program** is an opportunity to work closely with smart and innovative students/recent Graduates who are willing to experiment by building their idea on the Gno.land smart contract platform.

Follow the hackerspace repo for updates.

**Scope of the project**

**Cohort Details:** Based in Serbia

@stefann-01 
@JJOptimist 
@matijamarjanovic 
@ursulovic

**Duration**: December 6th - March 5

**Hours:** Part Time

**What We Are Looking for**

We will demonstrate from the basic of what can be built. We ask students to brainstorm what we lack in Gno compared to Solidity or Web2. Our goal is to engage with your curiousity.

There is potential to discuss the topic and to see if it makes sense to divide the team in four or to work on one project as a team. This is open for experiment.

We are open to hearing any **‘WildCard.’**

That being said, we have suggestions below to initiate some ideas:

**The student can experiment by building:**

**Contracts:** Simple Apps, Games, DeFi platforms… Developer Tools: IDE plugins, CI/CD, Linters, Analyzers… Generic/Reusable Libraries Integration/Client: Python/Node… Client, Bridge with other Systems Porting Web2 Apps to Gno.land Porting Web3 Contracts (Solidity, WASM, …) to Gno.land Architecture and Design: Tokenomics, Governance, DAO…

**Program Dates** ( December 6th 2024 - March 5th 2025) (1st Cohort) 

**Phase Dates**

Onboarding week Onboarding December 6th 
Phase 1 - Experiment Phase 1st Experiment Bootcamp December 6th 

Probation Review January 6th 
Phase 2 - Junior Builder Program 
Phase 2nd Junior builders 



**Phase 1 - Experiment Phase**

This is the educational phase, where the students would be educated on Gno, Gnoland and receive workshops and tutorials.

what is and why gno.land get started writing contracts suggestions / ideas of what they can try to do doc with list of contact/channels and how to communicate and make their reports This stage lasts up until end of June.

At the end of this phase, we decide if the students go to the next stage, which is the Proof of Concept/Prototype phase. We ask for a reporting, providing feedback and preparing for phase 2.

**Phase 2 - Junior Builder Program Phase**

Once you pass the initial phase, we provide a chance to turn your experiment into a proof of concept, a prototype, or simply advance your proposal into further experiments showcasing outcomes.

We will hold Junior Builder Cohort Hours with Manfred to help you dive deep into the challenges you are facing in your experiment, ideate solutions, and refine your solutions.

**Support during the program:**

Leon is going to be your main guide.

Our Developer Relations team aims to provide you with additional support through our developer relations team, to unblock any technical issues you face in the development of your project, or to provide you with further guidance and documentation material.

We will have our Github channel to keep track. The link will be shared following our set up.

Our developer relations team will have bi-weekly support call with the students (in group) to resolve questions.

SCP Alumni can help with questions as well.

Regarding any non-technical questions, you can email Valeh Tehranchi: Valeh.tehranchi@tendermint.com.
