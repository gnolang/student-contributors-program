# Student Contributors Program

## Zone01 - Rouen/FR Cohort

The Student Contributor Program is an opportunity to work closely with smart and innovative students/recent Graduates who are willing to experiment by building their idea on the [Gno.land](http://Gno.land) smart contract platform. 

Follow updates on the [hackerspace](https://github.com/gnolang/hackerspace/issues/59) repo.

## **Scope of the project**

### Cohort Details: based in France:

- @digix666
- @mous1985
- @kazai777
- @MalekLahbib

**Duration**: 3 months ( with potential extension to 4 months)

**Hours:** 30 - 40 hours a week / Full Time 

**What We Are Looking for** 

We will demonstrate from the basic of what can be built. We ask students to brainstorm what we lack in Gno compared to Solidity or Web2. Our goal is to engage with your curiousity. 

There is potential to discuss the topic and to see if it makes sense to divide the team in four or to work on one project as a team. This is open for experiment.

**We are open to hearing any ‘WildCard.’** 

That being said, we have suggestions below to initiate some ideas: 

The student **can experiment by building:** 

- Contracts: Simple Apps, Games, DeFi platforms…
- Developer Tools: IDE plugins, CI/CD, Linters, Analyzers…
- Generic/Reusable Libraries
- Integration/Client: Python/Node… Client, Bridge with other Systems
- Porting Web2 Apps to [Gno.land](http://Gno.land)
- Porting Web3 Contracts (Solidity, WASM, …) to Gno.land
- Architecture and Design: Tokenomics, Governance, DAO…

**Phase 1 - Experiment Phase**

This is the educational phase, where the students would be educated on Gno, Gnoland and receive workshops and tutorials. 

- what is and why gno.land
- get started writing contracts
- suggestions / ideas of what they can try to do
- doc with list of contact/channels and how to communicate and make their reports


This stage lasts up to one week. 

At the end of this phase, we decide if the students go to the next stage, which is the Proof of Concept/Prototype phase. We ask for a reporting, providing feedback and preparing for phase 2. 

**Phase 2 - Junior Builder Program Phase**

Once you pass the initial phase, we provide a chance to turn your experiment into a proof of concept, a prototype, or simply advance your proposal into further experiments showcasing outcomes. 

We will hold Junior Builder Cohort Hours with Manfred to help you dive deep into the challenges you are facing in your experiment, ideate solutions, and refine your solutions.

**Support during the program:**

@moul is going to be your main guide.

Our Developer Relations team @waymobetta, @michelleellen @leohhhn and @VT-Cosmos aim to provide the cohort with additional support, to unblock any technical issues you face in the development of your project, or to provide you with further guidance and documentation material.
