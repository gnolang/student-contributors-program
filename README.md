# Student Contributors Program

We are launching the Student Contributor Program in search of students or 
recent graduates who are willing to experiment with building their ideas on the 
gno.land smart contract platform.

The Student Contributor Program length is 3 to 4 months.

The program happens in cohorts, with the size of the cohort ideally being 6 persons.

### Hands-on Engagement from Blockchain Industry Experts

The Student Contributors will have access to hands-on support from gno.land
Contributors. Selected applicants will have the chance to share knowledge with 
technical and industry mentors who will provide guidance to accelerate their 
progress. The selected student contributors will participate in a bootcamp
including workshops and office hours.

### What We Are Looking for

This is an open playground for individual students to develop their own ideas and
build on top of gno.land without limiting them to predefined projects.

We are open to hearing any **‘WildCardʼ** suggestions!

That being said, we have listed some general areas of the possible contributions
to serve as inspiration. 

You can experiment by building:
- Contracts: Simple Apps, Games, DeFi platforms…
- Developer Tools: IDE plugins, CI/CD, Linters, Analyzers… 	Generic/Reusable Libraries
- Integration/Client: Python/Node… Client, Bridge with other Systems 	Porting Web2 Apps to gno.land
- Porting Web3 Contracts (Solidity, WASM, …) to gno.land
- Architecture and Design: Tokenomics, Governance, DAO…
